Robocode Game
**Project Specification**

Based on your knowledge of Robocode from the hackathon, develop a robot that will out-perform your classmate’s robot in a league event.
Your robot should have response patterns (at minimum) for the following methods:
onBulletHit(BulletHitEvent event)

onHitByBullet(HitByBulletEvent event) 

onHitRobot(HitRobotEvent event)

onHitWall(HitWallEvent event)


Your team must indicate which team member wrote each method and document its functionality. Each team needs to create a repository for the robot and add the lecturer to the project as a member.
There must be evidence that all members have both pulled code from the repository and committed changes to the project at each milestone review.

**Milestone reviews**

- The work period between each milestone is 2 weeks.

- At the end of the period the team will present their code, pull /
commit logs, and a short report to the lecturer for a code interview.
- Once the interviews have been completed, there will be another round of the class league. Each robot will earn points for is performance.

- Based on this event the team must produce and log a bug report for the features that need to be address in the next review.
There will be a total of 3 review cycles before a final league event.
Each review cycle will follow the same pattern, but the team must clearly indicate what changes have been made since the previous

**Project Iterations:**

- Initial iteration project; Develop an initial prototype to test for future
review. 20%

- Second iteration project; based on first review product a bug report
and update project features for future review. 20%

- Final iteration project; based on first review learner’s product a bug
report and update project features for final demonstration 20%

- Project Documentation; Comprehensive document that outlines the research taken for the project and documents the implementation
and testing process. 20%
